    StrategyCodeEnum.BF: "The 'Bracket Filling' strategy aims to smooth out your taxable income each year by withdrawing just enough from your RRSP/RRIF to bring your total taxable income up to a specific target level (e.g., top of a tax bracket or below OAS clawback threshold).",
    StrategyCodeEnum.GM: "The 'Gradual Meltdown' strategy focuses on withdrawing just enough from your RRSP/RRIF each year to meet your inflation-adjusted spending needs, while ensuring CRA minimums are met. Surplus cash is typically reinvested.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.MIN: "The 'RRIF Minimum Only' strategy is a baseline approach where you only withdraw the absolute minimum required by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) from your RRIF each year.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.E65: "The 'Early RRIF Conversion at 65' strategy involves converting some or all of your RRSP to a RRIF at age 65 (or earlier if eligible) to take advantage of the $2,000 pension income tax credit and enable pension income splitting with a spouse sooner.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.CD: "This 'CPP/OAS Delay' strategy involves using your RRSP funds to cover living expenses in your earlier retirement years (e.g., 65-70), allowing you to delay starting your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits. By doing so, these government pensions increase significantly for each year you defer them.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.SEQ: "The 'Spousal Income Splitting' strategy aims to reduce your household's overall tax bill by shifting taxable income (like RRIF withdrawals or eligible pension income) from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse, making use of lower tax brackets and potentially doubling up on credits like the pension income amount.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.IO: "The 'Interest-Offset Loan' strategy is an advanced technique where you might take an investment loan and use RRSP/RRIF withdrawals to pay the loan interest. If structured correctly, the loan interest can be tax-deductible, effectively reducing the net taxable amount of your RRIF withdrawals. This typically involves higher complexity and risk.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.LS: "The 'Lump-Sum Withdrawal' strategy involves taking a larger, one-time withdrawal from your RRSP/RRIF in a specific year. This might be done to fund a large purchase, pay off debt, or strategically realize income in a year where your tax bracket might be lower.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.EBX: "The 'Empty-by-X' strategy focuses on systematically depleting your entire RRSP/RRIF balance by a specific target age (e.g., age 85). This often involves withdrawing more than the CRA minimums each year.",
}

STRATEGY_TRADEOFFS = {
    # ... (Populate with typical trade-offs for each strategy) ...
    StrategyCodeEnum.CD: "A key consideration is that you'll be using more of your RRSP funds earlier. While this boosts your guaranteed government pensions later, it means less private capital for growth or unexpected large expenses in your 60s. This strategy is often best if you anticipate a long life expectancy.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.BF: "While this strategy provides predictable tax rates year to year, it might not always result in the absolute lowest lifetime tax bill, especially if your income needs vary significantly or if tax laws change. It prioritizes smoothness over aggressive tax minimization in any single year.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.EBX: "Depleting your RRIF early means you'll pay taxes on that income sooner, potentially at lower average rates if done carefully. However, it also means those funds are no longer growing tax-deferred within the RRIF, and you'll rely more on other income sources or TFSA/non-registered assets in later old age.",
    StrategyCodeEnum.MIN: "Withdrawing only the minimum preserves capital within your RRIF for longer, allowing for more tax-deferred growth. However, this can lead to larger RRIF balances later in life, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets or increasing OAS clawback when mandatory withdrawals become very high at older ages. It might also mean underspending relative to your needs if the minimum is low.",
